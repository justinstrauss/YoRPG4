Ye Olde Role Playing Game, Unchained
by Noah Brook, Marc Katz, and Justin Strauss (Brownlandia and the Hoopy Froods)

Our RPG Consists of:
- a Character superclass
- 5 hero subclasses of Character (Warrior, Archer, Mage, Ninja, and Tank)
- 2 dreaded-unnamed-assailant subclass of Character (Monster and Ogre)
- a YoRPG driver class

New Things Weâ€™ve Implemented:
- dodge is a new instance variable
- regenerate is a new abstract method
- getDodge is a new non-abstract method to coincide with the instance variable

Enjoy the game!
